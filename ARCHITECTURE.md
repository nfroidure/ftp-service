# Architecture Notes



## FTP Service

The `ftp` service creates easily usable FTP features
 by exposing `list`, `put`, `get` and `delete`
 methods and handling any unecessary complexity.

[See in context](./src/index.ts#L42-L47)



### Pool

The service uses a pool to allow several parallel connections
 to a FTP server.

[See in context](./src/index.ts#L125-L129)



### Retry and error casting

One can configure the FTP service to retry several times
 before abandonnating the requested operation.

[See in context](./src/index.ts#L324-L328)
